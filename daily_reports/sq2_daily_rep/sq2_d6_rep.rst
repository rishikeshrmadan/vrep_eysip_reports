MD Ruhulamin Khan
=================

Work Done
----------

	1. Final testing out the previous year arenas with out graph parser
	2. Identified problem arenas
	3. Wrote the guidelines for arena creation

Insights and Learnings:
-----------------------
	
	1. We have reached the point of diminishing returns. it might be more viable to recreate certain problematic arenas than to fix the parser further

=============

Work done:
----------
1. Exported a csv file from vrep for data processing, Made sure that most of the robotic simualtor exports the csv file for creating a common Auto-Evaluators
2. Downloading corealdraw & converting the .cdr file to .svg 
3. Worked on creating the a 3d model & importing with  same texture in vrep, as 2d model cannot be imported, but failed.
